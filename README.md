# Music-Data-Scraping
These files allow users to access acoustic analysis through the spotify web API as well as scrape lyrics for those songs from the web.
lyric_scraper.py uses the Genius API in order to scrape lyrical data from the web for naturla language processing
acoustic_extraction.py uses the Spotify API in order to access acoustic data of music. The current version averages data from all music put out by the artist,
but is easily modified for album or song selection.

Both APIs require client tokens.

These are base code that I am using for a larger music analysis project. This repository includes sample outputs for each file. Hope that this is useful for someone!
